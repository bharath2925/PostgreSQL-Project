--------VPC---------
What is a VPC?
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud lets you provision a logically isolated section of AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual 
  network you define.
- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selecting your own IP range, creating of subnets ,configuration
  of route tables and network gateways.
- You can easily customize your network config of your vpc. For ex: You can create public facing subnet for your webservers that has access 
  to the internet and place your backend systens such as databases and app servers in a private facing subnet with no internet access.
-You can leverage multiple layers of security , including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to ec2 in each subnet.
-YOu can also create a Hardware VPC connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the aws cloud as an extension 
  of your corporate datacenter
  
  
What can we do with VPC?
- Launch instances into your subnet of your choosing.
- Assing custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
- Configure route tables between subnets.
- Create internet gateways and attach it to your VPC.
- Much better security control of your AWS resources.
- Assign SG to each instances.
- Have Subnet network access control lists

Difference between default VPC and custom VPC.
- DVPC is user friendly, no networking knowledge needed, allowing to immediately deploy instances.
- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.
- By default, Each EC2 has a public and a private address.

VPC Peering: 
- Allows you to connect one VPC to another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
- You can peer VPC with other AWS accounts as well as other VPC's in the same account.
- You can peer between regions
- Peering is a star configuration, ie 1 VPC peers with 4 others. No Transitive Peering.

***Think of VPC as a logical Datacenter in AWS.
It consists of Internet Gateways(IGW's)/Virtual Private Gateways, Route tables, Network Access control lists, subnets and security groups.
1subnet can be speard in 1 az only. multiple subnets can be in 1 az. but 1 subnet cant be in multiple az.
Network ACL's are Stateless, which means you can allow rules and deny rules for ex if we add a inbound rule for a port we will have to add 
  an outbound rule for that port. in Security groups this is done by default making them stateful.
In VPC there is no Transitive Peering. Think of it like this:
      
          VPC-D
            ^
            |
VPC-A <-> VPC-B <-> VPC-E
            |
            ^
          VPC-C
Here VPC B is peered with A,C,D,E. But if A wants to communicate with D, It cannot communicate via B. This is called Transitive Peering.
This is NOT ALLOWED in VPC's. To communicate, We need to connect A and D in a separate connection.
