---------EC2----------
- EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in cloud.
It provides resizable compute capacity in cloud.
EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instance to minutes
Can change properties based on your computing requirements change.

Pay as you go
Pay less as you use more.

EC2 Pricing Models:(Remmember everything)
- On Demand: Pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
  -Useful for:
  1. Users who want low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long term commitment.
  2. Apps with short term, spiky or unpredictible workloads that cannot be interrupted.
  3. Apps developed or tested in EC2 for the first time.
- Reserved: Provides you with a capacity reservation and significant discount on hourly charge for an instance. Contract can be 1 year or 3 years
  -Useful for:
  1. Apps with steady state or predictible usage.
  2. Apps that require reserved capacity
  3. Users able to make upfront payment to reduce their computing costs even further.
  
  Types:
  1. Standard Reserve Instance: 75% off on demand instances. Cant convert one instance to another.
  2. Convertible Reserved Instances: Upto 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of Reserved Instance. Can convert to another instance when required.
  3. Scheduled Reserved Instance: Can launch within the time window you reserve.
- Spot Instance: We can bid whatever price you want for your instance. we get the server if we win the bid else we will loose it in 2 minutes.
  -Useful for:
  1. Apps with flexible start and end times.
  2. Apps that are feasible at very low compute prices.
  3. Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
- Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 servers in your work space.
  - Useful For:
  1. For users having regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
  2. Great for licensing which does not support multi tenancy or cloud deployments.
  3. Can be purchased on-Demand(Hourly).
  4. Can be purchased as reservation for upto 70% off the on demand price.

***Read all the Instance Types using the Mnemonic provided*** They wont ask it in the associate exam though***

***If the Spot Instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, You will not be charged for partial hour of usage.
If you terminate, You will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran***


-------EC2 Lab----------
1. Go to EC2 console.
2. Create Instance
3. Select the instance you need and select configure instance details.
4. AFter configuring instance details, Select storage options. Remmember, For root, the Volume type can be only SSD or Magnetic.
When we add new volume, We can see additional volume types.

--SEcurity Groups---
***Every time you make a change in the inbound rule or any other changes, The changes are effective immediately.***
-If you create a inbound rule for any type of request, AWS will automatically create an outbound rule for the same request. This functionality
is called as statefull
-We can block specific requests type to the SG. and we cannot block a specific IP address in SG
-When we create a security group. It automatically blocks all inbound traffic. We have to add inbound rules to allow the specific requests.
-All outbound traffic is allowed.
-We can add more than 1 sg to an EC2 Instance. This can be done by Actions->Change SG->select the SG you want
