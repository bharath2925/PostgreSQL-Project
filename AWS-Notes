3. Granular Permissions
4.Identity Federation(Allows users to access the AWS using theirLinkedIn or FB creds)
5. Multifactor Authentication
6. Provides Temporary Access
7. Own Password Rotation Policy
8. Supports PCI DSS Compliance(All Personal Data is secured)


Key Terms in IAM:
1. Users: End users such as people, employees etc
2. Groups: A collection of Users. Each user in the group will have specific permissions assigned to that group
3. Policies: Made up of docs. Formatted in JSON.Gives permissions on what the user/group is able to do
4. Roles: Create roles for each user which provides access for each stack in AWS. For ex we can request role access to a EC2 console to write files in the S3 bucket.

Root Account: The credentials you used to login in the first time. This creds will have god mode access

Hands On:
