---DNS---
-Route53 is the DNS service of AWS. DNS is on the port 53 so this is called as Route53.
-DNS is like a phonebook. It is used to converty human friendly domain names into an internet protocol(IP) address.
-IP address are used by computers to identify ea on the network. It commonly comes in 2 forms IPv4 and IPv6.
-IPv4 addresses are running out. IPv4 is a 32 bit field and has over 4 billion different addresses.
-Due to more number of devices connected, IPv6 was created with 128 bits of address space having about 340 x10 pow(36) different
  addresses.
-Looking at common domain names like google.com,bbc.co.uk etc. you will notice strings separated by dots. 
-The last work in a domain name is the top level domain. for ex: .co.in here in is top level domain..co is second level domain name.
-These domain names are controlled by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA).

-Bcoz all of the names in a given domain name have to be unique there needs to be a way to organize this all so that domain names aren't
  duplicated.
-This is where domain registrars come in, A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level
  domains.
-These domains are registered with InterNIC(Network Information Center), a service of ICANN(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
--ICANN enforces uniqueness of domain names across the internet.
-Each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as WhoIS database.
-Popular domain registrars inclues Amazon, GoDaddy.com,123-reg.co.uk etc.

-When you buy a dns. You will be given a Start of Authority Record(SOA). It stores info about:
  1.Name of server that supplied the data for the zone.
  2.The admin of the zone.
  3.The current version of the data file.
  4.The default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.

-NS Records: Thet are Name Server Records. They are used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to content DNS server which
  contains the authoritative DNS records.
  For ex: If a user tries to query a website. The Top Level Domain is queried first with the url, The TLD will share the 
  NS of the url. Then the NS Records database is queried to get the SOA. In SOA we will have our DNS records.
  
-"A" Record is a fundemental type of DNS record. The "A" in A Record stands for "Address". 
  The A record is used by computer to translate the name of the domain to an IP address.

-TTL(Time to Live): The length that a DNS record is cached on either the resolving server or the user own local PC is equal
  to the value of TTL in seconds. The lower the TTL, the fast changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet.
  -The default TTL is 48 hrs meaning, If i make a change to the DNS it will take 48 hrs for the change to take place across internet.
  
  
-CName: It is a Canonical Name that can be used to resolve one domain name to another.
  for ex: you may have a mobile website with the domain name m.A.com that is used for when user browse to your domain name on their mobile. 
   You may also want the name mobile.A.com to resolve to this same address.

-Alias Records: They are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CF distributions or
  s3 buckets that are configured as websites.
 -Alias records work like CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name to another target DNS name.
-There is a key difference though, A CNAME cant be used for naked domain names(aka zone apex record).You cant have a CNAME
  for http://acloud.guru, it must be either an A record or an Alias.
  
***ELB don have pre-defined IPv4 add.you resolve to them using a DNS name.
***Understand the difference between an Alias record and CNAME.
***Given a choice, always choose an Alias record over CNAME.
***Common DNS Types:
  1.SOA Records
  2.NS Records
  3.A Records
  4.CNAMES
  5.MX Records(Mail Exchanger used for mails)
  6.PTR Records(reverse of A record used to find the name using IP address)
